**Rules:**
This is a easy game to play and I'm sure it will bring you good memories from your childhood.
To be able to play, the user should run the "Main Class", and try to eat as much fruit as posible, without beating the walls or the snake body. Enjoy!

**History:**
Snake’s story begins long before it found a mass audience with Nokia. It was first created as a concept in 1976 under the name of Blockage, and was a monochromatic two-player arcade game developed by video games company, Gremlin Interactive. 
After launching in 1997 on the Nokia 6110, Snake quickly became a phenomenon.

**Project overview:**
This one-week Project was completed within 5 weeks of Mindera Code Academy bootcamp, in Java and mixing the learned concepts of Exceptions, I/O operations, Streams and Generics, without help of any framework. 
We were given the Field class to start, and had to implement all the logic of the game.
